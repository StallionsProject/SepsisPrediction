# Early Sepsis Prediction using Machine Learning

<hr/>

## Introduction

Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by the body's response to an infection. The body normally releases chemicals into the bloodstream to fight an infection. 
Sepsis develops when the chemicals the immune system releases into the bloodstream to fight an infection cause inflammation throughout the entire body instead.
Severe cases can damage multiple organ systems leading to septic shock. 

Our main objective here is to train a deep learning model in python using all the symptoms for predicting early sepsis onset. 
A doctor should get a good idea of whether a person is vulnerable to sepsis and get an early warning that can be crucial for treatment, based on the values entered into the model.

The application should be able to make these predictions using only a minimal set of streaming physiological data in real-time.
During the course of this project, using a [TYPE OF NEURAL NETWORK] and Neural Ordinary Differential Equations, 
a model will be developed to identify markers that predict the onset of sepsis in admitted patients.
The earlier sepsis onset can be detected and fewer false positives, less hospital resources are wasted saving large amounts of medical resources annually.  

We shall develop this application using the eICU database.
